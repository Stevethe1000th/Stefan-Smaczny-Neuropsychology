This contains a psychopy implementation of the McIntosh Line Bisection task. 
(e.g., McIntosh, R. D., Schindler, I., Birchall, D., & Milner, A. D. (2005). Weights and measures: A new look at bisection behaviour in neglect. Cognitive Brain Research, 25(3), 833-850.)
This specific method of Line Bisection is capable of extracting two additional factors apart from the typical "directional bisection error" (DBE) (= cm from left end of line), the Endpoint Weightings Bias (EWB) and the Endpoint Weightings Sum (EWS).
The EWB reflects the patient's individual weighting of the left and right endpoints of horizontal lines, while the EWS reflects the consistency of bisection over different line types (i.e, length and position). It was found that these measures relate better to other typical neglect diagnostic tools, such as cancellation tasks, than the DBE.

It additionally contains a manual that explains how to install Psychopy, run the experiment correctly, and extract and interpret the data output.
